# issue-with-spring-web-and-three

run ```npm run dev```

creates two apps (align port)
- http://localhost:3000/src/web_app/index.html
- http://localhost:3000/src/three_app/index.html

everything should be fine, the react logo is rotating and the also the cube

if you run ```npm run build``` and ```npm run preview``` go to (align port)
- http://localhost:4173/src/web_app/index.html
- http://localhost:4173/src/three_app/index.html

and the cube will rotate but not the react logo
